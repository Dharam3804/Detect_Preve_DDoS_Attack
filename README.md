# Threshold-Based Stack Ensemble for detection of DDoS in cloud 


In the present time, cyber-attacks are steadily increasing in cloud. 
Due to TCP, ICMP, UDP protocol-based DDoS attack, cloud-based system is unsafe. 
The rate of growth of DDoS cyber-attack is serious & challenging problem in network. 
TCP, UDP & ICMP-based DDoS flooding attack can easily notice and classify by MAD-stack ensemble.
in order to protect the cloud framework from DDoS cyber-attack, this project is proficient for classification of attack and benign requests. 
Project comprises three components:
   i: data pre-processing,
   ii: selection of optimal attribute and
   iii: detection & prevention form DDoS attack.
